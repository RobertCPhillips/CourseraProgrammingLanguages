Into:

In all problems, a “date” is an SML value of type int*int*int, where the ﬁrst part is the year, the second part is the month, and the third part is the day. 

A “reasonable” date has a positive year, a month between 1 and 12, and a day no greater than 31 (or less depending on the month). Your solutions need to work correctly only for reasonable dates, but do not check for reasonable dates (that is a challenge problem) and many of your functions will naturally work correctly for some/all non-reasonable dates. 

A “day of year” is a number from 1 to 365 where, for example, 33 represents February 2. (We ignore leap years except in one challenge problem.)

1. Write a function is_older that takes two dates and evaluates to true or false. It evaluates to true if the ﬁrst argument is a date that comes before the second argument. (If the two dates are the same, the result is false.)

val is_older = fn : (int * int * int) * (int * int * int) -> bool

fun is_older(firstDate:int*int*int, secondDate:int*int*int) =

    val secondMonth = #2 secondDate

    val secondDay =   #3 secondDate

2. Write a function number_in_month that takes a list of dates and a month (i.e., an int) and returns how many dates in the list are in the given month.

val number_in_month = fn : (int * int * int) list * int -> int
*)

fun number_in_month(dates:(int*int*int) list, month:int) =

    number_in_month_acc(dates, 0)

3. Write a function number_in_months that takes a list of dates and a list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns the number of dates in the list of dates that are in any of the months in the list of months. Assume the list of months has no number repeated. Hint: Use your answer to the previous problem

val number_in_months = fn : (int * int * int) list * int list -> int

fun number_in_months(dates:(int*int*int) list, months:int list) =

 (*
  Write a function dates_in_month that takes a list of dates and a month (i.e., an int) and returns a list holding the dates from the argument list of dates that are in the month. The returned list should contain dates in the order they were originally given.
  
 val dates_in_month = fn : (int * int * int) list * int -> (int * int * int) list

5.  Write a function dates_in_months that takes a list of dates and a list of months (i.e., an int list) and returns a list holding the dates from the argument list of dates that are in any of the months in the list of months.

6. Write a function get_nth that takes a list of strings and an int n and returns the nth element of the list where the head of the list is 1st. Do not worry about the case where the list has too few elements: your function may apply hd or tl to the empty list in this case, which is okay.

val get_nth = fn : string list * int -> string

    get_nth_acc(lst, 1)

(*
7. Write a function date_to_string that takes a date and returns a string of the form January 20, 2013 (for example). Use the operator ^ for concatenating strings and the library function Int.toString for converting an int to a string. For producing the month part, do not use a bunch of conditionals. Instead, use a list holding 12 strings and your answer to the previous problem. For consistency, put a comma following the day and use capitalized English month names: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December.

val date_to_string = fn : int * int * int -> string 
*)

fun date_to_string(date:(int*int*int)) =

    get_nth(months, #2 date) ^ " " ^ Int.toString(#3 date) ^ ", " ^ Int.toString(#1 date)

(*
8. Write a function number_before_reaching_sum that takes an int called sum, which you can assume is positive, and an int list, which you can assume contains all positive numbers, and returns an int. You should return an int n such that the ﬁrst n elements of the list add to less than sum, but the ﬁrst n + 1 elements of the list add to sum or more. Assume the entire list sums to more than the passed in value; it is okay for an exception to occur if this is not the case.

val number_before_reaching_sum = fn : int * int list -> int
*)

fun number_before_reaching_sum(sum:int, numbers:int list) = 
  let
    fun number_before_reaching_sum_acc(accNumbers:int list, accSum:int, accIndex:int)
      if accSum >= sum
      then accIndex
      else number_before_reaching_sum_acc(tl accNumbers, accSum+(hd accNumbers), accIndex+1)

    number_before_reaching_sum_acc(numbers, 0, 0)
